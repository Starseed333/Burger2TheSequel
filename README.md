# **Burger2TheSequel**

# 


### **Description**

A full stack application using the MVC system.  The app presents you with an available list of ready to "devour" burgers on the left side of the page. You can click on the one you would like and enter your name to claim your burger! This then sends the "devoured" burger to the right side of the screen where either a) you can request seconds or b) you can delete the burger from the archives. Beware, too many clients are getting creative requesting special burgers, therefore, you will have to think outside the box to create a unique authentic burger! Enjoy!!

#### MVC - A software architecture

The Model manages fundamental behaviors and data of the application. It can respond to requests for information, respond to instructions to change the state of its information, and even to notify observers in event-driven systems when information changes. This could be a database, or any number of data structures or storage systems. In short, it is the data and data-management of the application.

The View effectively provides the user interface element of the application. It'll render data from the model into a form that is suitable for the user interface.

The Controller receives user input and makes calls to model objects and the view to perform appropriate actions.
